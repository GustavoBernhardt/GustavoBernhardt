I have some experience as a salesman in retail from my teenage years, and more recently I have been closing B2B deals with supermarkets B2C deals
for providing catering in social events. Furthermore, I have also been engaging in digital marketing as yet another attempt to grow my business. 
On top of this, I have excellent communication skills and I'm an extremely patient individual, having taught English classes to people of all ages
for many years. I consider myself a tech savvy individual, and I am now pursuing a degree in IT as well.

I'm confident that, if given the chance, I can excel in any position and be an asset to the company. While my main motivation is the opportunity 
to have a second revenue stream that I can use to invest in my business, I want to be clear that I will be fully dedicated to accomplishing my 
goals in any position, relentlessly so.
